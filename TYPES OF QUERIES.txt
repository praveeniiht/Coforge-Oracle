QUERY TYPES
-----------

1. ROOT QUERY
2. PARENT QUERY OR QUTER QUERY OR MAIN QUERY
3. CHILD QUERY OR INNER QUERY OR SUB QUERY


Root Query:  The query which is not depend on any other query for its conditions value.
-----------
or Independent query.

eg. select ename, sal from emp where deptno =10;


parent query:
-------------

The query which depend on any other query for its condition value.
CREATE


Sub Query:
----------

1. The query which provides, conditional values to its parent query.

2. A sub query in the WHERE clause of a SELECT statement is called as NESTED SUBQUERY.

3. A sub Query in the FROM clause of a SELECT statement is called as INLINE VIEW.

4. A sub query can be part of a column, in the SELECT list.

5. sub query can contain another sub query.

6. Oracle imposes no limit on the number of sub squery leves in the FROM clause of the top level
   query.

7. within the WHERE clause up to 255 sub queries can be nested.

8. To make the statement easier for readibility, qualify the columns in a sub query with the table
   or table alias.

NOte: Parent query and sub query both are combined.


Purpose of Sub Query
--------------------

1. To define the set of rows to be inserted into the target table of an INSERT or CREATE TABLE
   statement.

2. To define the set of rows to be included in a view or a materialized INSERT or CREATE TABLE
   statmenet.

3. To define one or more values to be asigned to existing rows in UPDATE statement.

4. to provide values for condition in a WHERE clause, HAVING clause START WITH clause of 
   SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE statements.

SUB QUERY PRINCIPLE
-------------------

1. Solve a problem by combining the two queries, placing one query inside the othe query.

2. The inner query or the sub query returns a value that is used by the outer query upon 
   the main query.

SUb QUery USAGE
---------------

1. A sub query is a select statement that is embedded in a clause of anothe SELECT statement.

2. We can build powerful statements out of simple ones by using Sub QUeries.

3. They can be very useful when you need to select rows from a table with a condition that

   depends on the data in the table itself.

syntax:
-------


	SELECT select_list FROM TABLE
        WHERE Columnname/expr operator 
	( SELECT select_list FROM TABLE);


comparision conditions fall into two classes:
---------------------------------------------

1. Sigle row operators (>,= ,>=, <, <= )

2. Multiple row operators (IN, ANY, ALL)


SINGLE ROW SUB QUERIES:
-----------------------

These queries returns only one row from the Inner SELECT statement.

MULTIPLE ROW SUB QUERIES:
-------------------------
These queries returns more than one row from the Inner SELECT statement.


Guidelines for Using SUbQueries
-------------------------------

1. Enclosed sub queries in parentheses.

2. Place sub queries on the right side of the comparision conditio.

3. The ORDER BY clause in the sub query is not needed unless you are performing top analysis.

4. Only one ORDER BY clause can be used for a SELECT statement.

5. Two classes of comparision conditions are used in Sub Queries
   --> Single row operators.
   --> MUltiple row operators.


Simple SubQuery:  Sub Query processed first and processed completely
----------------

Co related sub Query: 
---------------------

In the co related sub query a parent query will be exexcuted first and based on the output of 
outer query the inner query execute.

IF the parent query returns N rows inner query executed for N times.

examples for simple sub query with single row:
-----------------------------------------------

1. select empno, ename, sal, deptno from emp
   where sal < ( select sal from emp where empno= 7566);


2. select empno, ename, job from emp
   where job = ( select job from emp where ename =Upper('ford')) ;


3. Select empno, ename, hiredate, sal job from emp
   where hiredate > (select hiredate from emp where ename ='MILLER')
   ORDER by sal;

4. select empno, ename, sal, job from emp
   where deptno = (select deptno from dept where dname='sales');

5. select empno, ename, sal, job from emp
   where deptno = (select deptno from dept where loc= 'NEW YORK') and job = 'CLERK';


6. select empno, ename, sal, job from emp
   where deptno = (Select deptno from dept where dname ='SALES');


7. select empno, ename, sal, comm, sal+NVL(comm,0) from emp
   where deptno = (select deptno from dept where loc='CHICAGO' );


8. select * from emp where deptno = (select deptno from emp where ename='FORD') and
   job in (select job from emp where deptno= (select deptno from dept where dname='SALES'));


Applying GROUP functions in SUB QUERIES
---------------------------------------

1. The data from the main query can be displayed by using a Group function in a sub query.

2. As a group function returns a single row, the query passes the success state. The inner 
   sub query should not have a group by clause in this scenario.


eg.>

1. select ename, job, sal from emp
   where sal = (select max(sal) from emp );


2. select ename, job , sal from emp
   where sal =(select min(sal) from emp );

3. select ename, job, sal from emp
   where sal>(select avg(sal) from emp);

4. select ename, job,sal from emp
   where sal <(select variance(sal) from emp);


Appliying HAVING clause with Sub Queries
----------------------------------------

1. A sub query can be also applied in HAVING clause.
2. The oracle server executes the sub query, and the result are 
   returned into the having clause of the main query.

eg>
Display the depts whose min salaries are greater than the
min salary of deptno 20;

1. select dept, min(sal) from emp
   group by dept having min(sal) >
   (select min(sal) from emp where dept=20);


Display the jobs whose avg sal equal to the minimum of avg salaries
of the job

2. select job, avg(sal) from emp
   group by job having avg(sal) = 
  (select min(avg(sal)) from emp group by job);


3. select job, avg(sal) from emp
   group by job having avg(sal) <
   (select max(avg(sal)) from emp group by job );


Sub Query returns more than one row:
------------------------------------

1. sub queries that return more than one row are called multiple 
   row sub queries.

2. we use a multiple row operator instead of a single row operator,
   with a multiple row sub query.

3. use multiple row comparision operators.


	IN --> Equal to any one memeber in the list.

	ALL --> compare value to every value returned by the 
                sub query.


eg>
display the details of employees getting max salary in each
dept.

1. select ename, sal, dept from emp
   where sal in (select max(sal) from emp group by deptno );


2. select ename, sal, job, dept from emp
   where sal in (select max(sal) from emp group by job);

3. select ename, sal, deptno from emp
   where sal in (select min(sal) from emp group by deptno);


ANY Operator
------------

1. select ename, sal, deptno from emp
   where sal < SOME(1250,1500,1600);


2. select ename, sal, deptno from emp
   where sal < SOME( (select sal from emp where job='SALESMAN');

3. select ename, sal, deptno, job from emp
   where sal < ANY(select sal from emp where deptno in (20,30) and job <> 'MANAGER' );


4. select empno, ename, sal, deptno from emp
   where sal > ANY(select sal from emp where deptno = 10);


Note: < ANY means less than the maximum value in the list.
----------------------------------------------------------

eg. 

1. select ename, sal, deptno from emp where sal > SOME(1250,1500,1600);


2. select ename, sal, deptno from emp where sal > ANY(select sal from emp where job='SALESMAN');


Note: > ANY means more than the minimum value in the list.
----------------------------------------------------------

eg.

1. select ename, job, deptno from emp
   where al = ANY(select sal from emp where job='MANAGER');


= ANY it is equvilanet to IN Operator.


ALL OPerator
------------


1. select ename, job, sal, dept from emp
   where sal > ALL(select sal from emp where dept=20);
  
2. select ename, job, sal, deptno from emp
   where sal > all(select avg(sal) from emp group by deptno);


NOte: > ALL means more than the maximum in the list

1. select ename, job, sal, deptno from emp
   where sal>all(select avg(sal) from emp group by deptno );

USING SET OPERATORS
-------------------


1. The set opearators combine the results of two or more component queires into one result,
   Queries containing SET operators are called compound queries.

2. The number of columns and the data types of the columns being selected must be identical in all
   the select statements used in the query.  The names of the columns need not be identical

3. All SET operators have equal predence, if a sql statement contains multiple set operators, the oracle
   server evaluates them from left to right if no parenthesis explicitly mentioned.

Different SET operators.
-----------------------

1. UNION

2. UNION ALL

3. INTERSECT

4. MINUS

Note: When ever these operators are used to select stateent must have 

1. equal number of columns

2. similar data types

UNION
-----

1. It returns all the rows

guidelines;
----------
1. NULL values are not ignored during duplicate checking.
2. By default, the output is sorted in ascending order of the first column of the select clause.
3. the IN operator has a higher precendence that union operator.
4. UnionAll combines all elements including duplicates.


INTERSECT
---------
It returns all rows common to multiple queries.

guidelines:
-----------
1. Reversing the order of the intersected tables does not alter the result.
2. it does not ignore NULL values.

 MINUS
------
The minus operator returns rows from the first query that are not present in the second query.

Examples
---------

1. SELECT JOB FROM EMP1 WHERE DEPTNO=10 
   UNION 
   SELECT JOB FROM EMP2 WHERE DEPTNO = 20

2. SELECT DEPTNO, JOB FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=10 UNION 
   SELECT DEPTNO, JOB FROM EMP WHERE DEPTO=20;

3. SELECT EMPNO,ENAME FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=10 UNION 
   SELECT EMPNO, ENAME FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=20 ORDER By 2;

4. SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=(SELECT DEPTNO FROM DEPT WHERE DNAME='SALES')
   UNIOIN
   SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,JOB FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=(SELECT DEPTNO FROM DEPT WHERE DNAME='ACCOUNTING');

5. SELECT DEPTNO, JOB FROM EMP WHEE DEPTNO=10 UNION ALL SELECT DEPTNO, JOBB FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=20;

6. SELECT JOB FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=10 INTERSECT SELECT JOB FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=20;

7. SELECT JOB FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=10 MINUS SELECT JOB FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=20;

8. SELECT DEPTNO, JOB FROM EP WHERE DEPTNO=10 UNION SELECT DEPTNO, JOB FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=20;

9. SELECT DEPTNO, JOB FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO =10 INTERSECT SELECT DEPTNO, JOB FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO =30;

10. SELECT DEPTNO, JOB FROM EP WHERE DEPTNO=10 INTERSECT SELECT DEPTNO, JOB FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=20;
