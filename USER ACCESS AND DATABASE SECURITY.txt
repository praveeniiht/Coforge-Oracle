USER ACCESS AND DATABASE SECURITY
---------------------------------

1. used to share the data, database objects with other users.

2. users can also cancel the permission.

3. use the GRANT and REVOKE statements to grant and revoke object previligies.


Privilege:
----------

Privilege are the right to execute a particular SQL statement.


Schemas:
--------
A schema is a collection of objects, such as table, views and 
sequences.  The schema is 
owned by a database user and has the same name as that user.

GRANT:
------

The GRANT command is used to allow another schema access to a privelege.

GRANT command can be issued not only on TABLE object, but also on VIEWS, SYNONYMS, SEQUENCES etc

The users are GRANTED at time all four(ie., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT) by using ALL.


syntax:
-------

	GRANT <priviliege1[,<Privilege2>[,....] ON <OBJECTNAME> TO USER1 USER|ROLE, PUBLIC ...


CREATING USERS:
---------------

SYNTAX:
		CREATE USER <USERNAME> IDENTIFIED BY <PASSWORD>
EG>		CREATE USER PRAVEEN IDENTIFIED BY KUMAR.
		GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO <USERNAME>
		GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO PRAVEEN.

Login as Scott
--------------

	SQL> grant all on emp to praveen.

	sql> grant insert,select, update on dept to praveen.

Grant columns
-------------
	sql> grant insert(empno,ename,sal,deptno) on emp to 
         praveen.


Note:
-----
	1. Only insert and update permission are allowed.
	
	SQL> GRANT SELECT ON STUDENT TO USERA, USERB
	sql> GRANT DELETE ON SUPP TO PUBLIC;


PUBLIC: Public keyword represents all users in database.
	All users can delete on supp table.

Note:
-----

	we cannot give permission at time on more than on 
        datbase object.


steps to be performed 
---------------------

1. connect to the required user using the USER name and password.
2. execute the required sQL statement using the object hierarchy.


Login as praveen
----------------

	sql> select * from scott.emp;
	sql> insert into scott.dept values(50,'SW','HYD');
	sql> select * from scott.student;
Note: At time of DML, DRL operations we have to mention owners name.


REVOKE COMMAND
--------------

1. It is used to remove the access allowed by GRANT
2. REVOKE privileges is assigned not only on TABLE OBJECT, but also on VIEWS, SYNONYMS, 
   SEQUENCES etc.,

 
syntax:
-------
 REVOKE <privilege1>[,privilege2....] ON <OBJECTNAME> FROM USER1 [,USER | ROLE, PUBLIC];


sql> REVOKE SELECT ON STUDENT FROM PRAVEEN,USERA;

sql> REVOKE ALL ON EMP from PRAVEEN;


TYPES OF PRIVILEGES : 1. SYSTEM PRIVILEGES AND 2. OBJECT PRIVILEGES
-------------------

SYSTEM PRIVILEGES:
------------------

They allow a user to perform certain action within the database.

object Privileges:
------------------
An object privilege allow a user to perform certain actions on database objects.


Checking the Object privileges granted:
---------------------------------------

1. The schema object  that stores the information about the privileges granted is 
   USER_TAB_PRIVS_MADE;

2. The columns of USER_TAB_PRIVS_MADE ARE:
	GRANTEE
	TABLE_NAME
	GRANTOR
	PRIVILEGE
	GRANTABLE
	HIERARCHY

sql> select GRANTEE,TABL_NAME,GRANTOR, PRIVILEGE from USER_TAB_PRIVS_MADE WHERE TABLE_NAME='EMP'


USER_COL_PRIVS
--------------

This table query to view to the object privileges granted to the user on specific columns.

syntax:
	SELECT GRANTEE,GRANTOR, COLUMN_NAME FROM USER_COLS_PRIVIS WHERE TABLE_NAME='EMP';

	select grantee from all_tab_privis where grantor='scott' and table_name='emp';


Checking OBject privileges Received:
------------------------------------

The schema object that stores the information about the privileges that are received is 
USER_TAB_PRIVS_RECD.

The columns of USER_TAB_PRIVS_RECD ARE

1. OWNER
2. GRANTEE
3. TABLE_NAME
4  GRANTOR
5. PRIVILEGE
6. GRANTABLE
7. HIERARCHY


sql> select owner,table_name,grantor,privlege from user_tab_privis_recd;


Roles in Oracle:
----------------

A role is named group of related privileges that can be granted 
to the user.

Advantages:
-----------

1. Rather than assiging privileges one at a time directly to a user, we can create
   a ROLE, assign privivleges to that role, and then grant that role to multiple users

2. When you add or delete a privilege from a role, all users and roles assigned that role
   automatically receive or lose those privileges.

3. we can assign multiple rows to  a single user or roll to another role.

4. a role can be assigned with a password.

ROLES creation
--------------

1. To create a role we should have the cREATE ROLE SYSTEM privilege
2. Steps to implement the role:
	2.1 Roles creation.
	2.2 Granting privileges to roles
	2.3 Granting roles to users or objects.

Syntax:
'	CREATE ROLE <ROLENAME> IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD.

	create role sales_manager identified by salesaudit.


Note: 
------

We can alter ther ROLE for password and new password.

sql> alter ROLE sales_manager identified by salesaudit;

GRANT A ROLE TO A USER
----------------------

sql> GRANT SALES_MANAGER TO SCOTT;

GRANTING MULTIPLE ROLES TO USER
-------------------------------

SQL> GRANT ROLE1, ROLE2,....TO USER;

Checking ROLES granted to a user
--------------------------------

1. The schema object USER_ROLE_PRIVS specifies the ROLES granted to a USER.

2. The colmn of USER_ROLE_PRIVS

   USERNAME, GRANTED_ROLE, ADMIN_OPTION, DEFAULT_ROLE, OS_GRANTED

SQL> SELECT USERNAME, GRANTED, ROLE FROM USER_ROLE-PRIVS;


System priviliges granted to a Role
-----------------------------------

The Schema object ROLE_SYS_PRIVS specifies the SYSTEM privileges granted to a ROLE.

The columns of ROLE_SYS_PRIVS
  ROLE, PRIVILEGE, ADMIN_OPTION


Object Privileges granted to a ROLE
-----------------------------------
GRANT privileges ON object TO role_name

Privileges are: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, INDEX, ALL

EG: GRANT select, insert, update, delete ON suppliers TO test_role;
    GRANT all ON suppliers TO test_role;

Revoking privileges from the role
----------------------------------
syntax: REVOKE privileges ON object FROM role_name;
eg: REVOKE delete ON suppliers FROM test_role;
    REVOKE all ON suppliers FROM test_role;
Note: we can revoke one or more assigned privileges from the role

When dealing with functions / procedures / triggers

GRANT EXECUTE ON object TO role_name;
GRANT execute ON Find_Value TO test_role;

REVOKE execute ON object FROM role_name;
REVOKE execute ON Find_Value FROM test_role;

Granting a Role to User
-----------------------
GRANT role_name TO user_name;
GRANT test_role TO smithj;

To remove the Role
------------------
REVOKE role_name from user_name;
REVOKE role_name from smithj;
