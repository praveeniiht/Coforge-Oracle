Database Management Systems
----------------------------

Database Management System is a software that is used to create, 
maintain and provide controled access to user databses.

Database Management systems should provide systematic method of
	-> creating the database
	-> updating the database
	-> Storing the database
	-> Retrieving the data from database
	-> Mainting different levels of security

Expected features of DBMS software
----------------------------------

1. Enable end user and application programmers to share the data.
2. Enable data shared among multiple applicaiton.
3. Should not propagate and store data in new files for every new 
   application.
4. Should provide facilty for
	a. controlling data access
	b. enforce data integrity
	c. manage concurrency control
	d. restoring the data in system failure.


Evolution of DBMS
-----------------

It is introduced in 1960's
relational model first defined by E.F Codd (IBM) in 1970.


Objectives 
----------

1. Reduce the maintenance cost of software.
2. Manage the complex data types.
3. Provide easier and faster access to data even for end user.



Different Data Models
---------------------
1. Flat file DBMS
2. Hierarchical DBMS
3. Network Data DBMS
4. Relational DBMS
5. Object Relational DBMS

purpose of DataModels
----------------------
communicate, describe, investigate, analyze and categorize.



Database as per Oracle
----------------------

-> As per oracle database is collection of data in one or more 
   number of files.
-> The database is a collection of logical structures and physical structures
   which are integrated and configured for the integrity of the 
   system.



Logical Structures
-------------------

* In design state the system is represented in the form of Entity 
  Relational model.

* In the database state is representation of the actual metadata of the 
  database management system software which will be in the form of tablespaces,
  data dictionary objects etc.,

CREATE TABLE <TABLENAME> (COL DATTYPE(SIZE),.......);


Physical Structures
-------------------

1. In this the system is represented in the form of tables, 
   indexes etc.,
2. Database should have the ability to provide access to external tables for
   files outside the database, as if the rows in the files were rows in the 
   table.
3. Creating structures( Tables and Indexes)
4. With in the oracle database, the basic structure is a table 
   used to store data.



Understanding the oracle sytle for the data storage
----------------------------------------------------

-> All the logical structures in the datbase must be stored with 
   in the database only
-> Oracle maintains a data dictionary, which records metadata 
   about all the database objects.
-> The database objects which need physical storages space on the 
    computer system, are allocated space within the tablespace.


Table Space
-----------

-> It is logical storage unit within oracle database and is not 
   visible in the filesystem of the machine on which the database 
   resides.

-> The table space builds the bridge betweeen the oracle database 
  and the file system in which the table's or index data is stored.

-> A data file can be part of one and only one table space.

-> There are three types of table spaces in oracle
	1. permanent table space.
	2. undo table space.
	3. temporary table space.

Permanent Tablespace
---------------------
 permanent tablespace contains persistent schema objects, 
 Objects in permanent tablespaces are stored in datafiles.

Undo tablespace
----------------
An undo tablespace is a type of permanent tablespace used by 
Oracle Database to manage undo data if you are running your 
database in automatic undo management mode.

Temporary tablespace
--------------------

A temporary tablespace contains schema objects only for the 
duration of a session.

Objects in temporary tablespaces are stored in tempfiles.


-> Each table or index stored in an oracle database belongs 
   to a table space.

-> in 10g or later a big file table space can be created, 
   which can grow to the size of Tera Bytes of 
   space in on the disk.
