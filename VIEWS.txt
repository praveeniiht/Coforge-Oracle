VIEWS
-----
A view logical arrangement of data on a table in the Oracle.

It can be defined as an stored select statement.

It will not hold data or store data by itself.

It is a logical tabel based on one or more tables or views.

view can be created based on a table called a Base table.

View can be created as Object Views or Relational Views.
The Object views support

LOBs, OBject types, REFs, Nested Tabes, and Varrays.

DML, DESC, SELECT allowed or views.

Prerequisites:
--------------

1. Should have create view system previlege.
2. To create sub view, we need UNDER ANY VIEW system privilege
3. The Owner of the schema should have SELECT,INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE rows from all
   tables or views on which VIEW is based.
4. The above privileges must be granted the privilege directly, rather than a role.

Advantages of Views:
--------------------

1. provides high security while sharing data between users.
2. USER-VIEWS hold the details of views(date dictionary table).
3. view can be used to make simple queires to retrieve the result of complicated queries.
4. Views provide groups of users acces to according to their particular criteria.

SYNTAX:
-------

	CREATE [OR REPLACE] [FORCE | NO FORCE] VIEW VIEW_NAME 
 	[ AliasName1[,AliasName2....] As SubQuery
	WITH { CHECK OPTION/READ ONLY}
	CONSTRAINT constraintname ];

	OR REPLACE: Re creates the view if already exists.
	FORCE: specifies the view should not be create if the base table does not exits, 
	       which is default.
	NO FORCE: creates the view only if the base tables exists, which is the default.

Alias Name: Specifies names for the expression selected by the view query.

WITH CHECK OPTION: Specifies that only rows accessible to the view can be INSERTED or UPDATED
 		   or DELETED.

CONSTRAINT: CONSTRAINT is the name assigned tO the WITH CHECK OPTION or READ ONLY constraint.

WITH READ ONLY: ensures that no DML operations can be performed on this view.

Types of VIEWS
--------------

Simple Views:
-------------
	The view which is created wihtout following clauses:
	Join Condition, Group By, Having Clause, SET Operators 
        and Distinct.

Complex Views:
	The view which is created with any restriction clause is called complex view.
	complex views can contain sub queries.
	The sub query can contain, queries, that retrieve from multiple base tables. groups
	rows using by GROUP BY or DISTINCT cloause, contain a function call.

Selecting Data from View:
-------------------------

sql> SELECT NAME, JOB FROM EMPLOYEES;

SQL> SELECT 'EMP ID', NAME, "BASIC SALARY" SAL*12 FROM EMPLOEES;

SQL> select empno, name, to_char("Basic Salary", '99,99,999.99') Monthly, "Basic Salary"*12 Annual
     from employes where "Basic Salary" > 2500;

COMPLEX VIEW EXAMPLES
---------------------



SQL> 		Create VIEW EmpInfo As
		SELECT E.EMPNO Employee NO, E.ename Name, D.Deptno DepartmentId,
		D.DName DepratmentName from Emp e, Dept D
		where D.deptno = E.deptno
		Order by D.Deptno;

sql> create view empgrades as select e.ename name, e.sal basic, s.grade grade
     from emp e, salgrade s
     where e.sal between s.losal and s.hisal order by s.grade.

sql> create view empmanager as select rownum serialno, Initcap(e.ename)||'works under'||m.ename
     "Employee and managers" from emp e, emp m where e.mgr = m.empno;

sql> create or replace VIEW orgDesignations as
     select job from emp where deptno=10 union 
    select job from emp where deptno in (20,30);


VIEW IN DATA DICTIONARY:
------------------------

Once the view has been created, we can query upon the DATA DICTIONARY table user called
USER_VIEWS to see the name and definition of the view.

The TEXT of the SELECT statement that constitutes the VIEW is stored in a LONG Column.


SELECT GRANTEE FROM All_Tab_Privs where grantor='system' and table_name='OrgDesg';

Creating views with columns declarations
----------------------------------------
eg>
	CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW EMPV (ID_NUMBER,NAME,SAL,DEPARTMENT_ID) AS SELECT EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DEPTNO FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO=20;



Retrieving Data from View:
--------------------------

1. Retriees the view definition from the data dictionary table USER_VIEWS
2. check the access priviloeges for the view.
3. We can retrieve data from a view as you would from any table.
4. we can display either the contents of the entire view or just specific rows and columns.

sql> SELECT GRANTEE FROM ALL_TABS-PRIVS WHERE GRANTOR='SCOTT' AND TABLE_NAME='OrgDesignations';


Modify a View:
--------------


1. OR REPLACE Option is used to modify an existing view with a new definiton.
2. A VIEW can be altered without dropping, recreating and regranting object privileges.

3. The assigned column aliases in the CREATE VIEW clause are listed in the same order as the 
   column in the sub query.

Creating Views with columns Declarations
----------------------------------------

When a VIEW is being created, we can specify the names of the columns, that it can project,
along with the view definition.


SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW EmpV (id_number,name,sal, department_id) as 
     sELECT empno, ename,sal, deptno FROM emp where deptno = 30;

sql> select * from empv;

sql> create view vdept20 as select * from emp where deptno = 20;


INSERTING THE TOTAL DATA OF EMPLOYEES FROM DEPARTMENT 20 USING VIEW:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

sql> create table dept20 as select * from vdept20;

sql> create table empgrades (employee, designation, basicsalary, grade) as
     select ename,job,sal,grade from emp e, salgrade s where e.sal between
     s.losal and s.hisal;


DROPPING VIEW:
--------------

1. A view can remove wihout losing data, because a view is based on underlying tables in the
   databae.

2. The DROP VIEW statement is used to remove a view permanently

3. Dropping a view has no effect on the tables upon which the iew is created.

4. VIEWS or APPLICATIONS based on deleted views become invalid.

5. we need DROP ANY VIEW privileges to remove the VIEWS.

syntax:
-------
		> DROP VIEW viewname;
		> DROP VIEW EMPGRADE;

INLINE VIEWS:
-------------

1. An INline view is a subquery with an aliases (or correlation) that you can use within
   a sql statement.

2. an inline view is not a scheme object.

3. An inline view is placing a subquery in the FROM clause and giving that subquery an alias.


examples:
--------

sql> select e.ename, e.sal, e.deptno, i.maxsal
     from em e, (select deptno, max(sal) from emp group by Deptno) i
     where e.deptno = i.deptno and e.sal < i.maxsal;

Rules for performing DML 
-------------------------

1. dml operations can be performed upon a table through view.
2. a row can be removed from a view unless it contains.

	join conditon
	group by clause
	having clause
	set operators
	distinct / unique keyword
	the column defined by expressions

3. data can be added through a view, unoless it contains any of the above rules
   and there are not NUT NULL columns.
